How to push to github
use ls and cd .. to get to the folder of the file you are wanting to push
to get in file use cd filename
git add (file name) 
git commit -m "text must be in quotes"

This repository will be used for code created in Atom strictly for school. If anything comes up that I must code something for another reason 
I will probably put it in a different repository for the sake of organization

My goals are to understand a little bit more about coding for a purpose in general and I hope that this can help me.
